## Hey 🙌

I'm Lorenzo, an Informatic Engineering student based in Argentina.

Currently a hobbyist, mainly code personal projects in Java or Python. 

My main projects currenty are based on coding games from scratch without a game engine, coding every part by myself, which gave me some knowledge in optimization and algorithmic thinking. 

I use draw.io to UML design my projects and (try my best to) follow Object Oriented Programming paradigm.

I'll be uploading small and big personal projects and things I'm working on.
